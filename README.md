# Checkpoint 4

The scripts at this checkpoint allow you to deploy, mint, and integrate your Sui coin to Axelar's Interchain Token Service (ITS).

You can integrate with ITS by running:

```bash
node scripts/integrateAxelar.js --coinPackageId 0xadbcee9b996c4c52f13506f5d41c9e246e6286586dc2687346d51e8bb45807b7
```

The logs from the successfully run script should be:

```bash
âœ… Coin registration completed:
